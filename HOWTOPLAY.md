# How to play?

This MD file will (attempt) to guide you through the game (that is, if you are completely clueless as to what a first-person game is.)
Anyway, let's move on to the controls:

## The controls

Move around in-game using W, A, S, and D.
Look around using your mouse.
(I will assume you already know the controls.)

## The main menu

The main menu is a garbage dump. Simply put, each button redirects you to a specific "scene".
Feel free to roast me about the UI. I'm very aware that it sucks.
At least it's (somewhat) intuitive, but there's no way to return to it. I blame Godot's circular reference limitations for this.

## Fun

...Yeah, figure that out yourself.

## How do I prevent in-game NPCs from becoming self-conscious?

That isn't an implemented feature (and nor is it an encountered bug.) You're probably seeing things that you shouldn't be able to see.
Either way, good luck with that.

## Sadness

See the section named "Fun".

## How long is this document?

As long as it needs to be.

## Who's Mors?

Never heard of him.

## No, seriously, who is he?

See the section named "Who's Mors?" for your answer.

## Filler text

Filler text

## Curiosity

See the section named "Fun".

## I can't fit the game onto a cheap USB drive.

The awful game size is (partly) Godot's fault. I try my best to make the assets as small as possible using methods such as indexed colors and repetition.
