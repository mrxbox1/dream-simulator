# "Dream Simulator"
Work in progress - the name pretty much explains it all

## What is this?
This is a project that I'm working on. It's sort of a game...maybe if you just squint your eyes really hard or something, because it's currently just a load of garbage with little to no gameplay.
As the name might suggest, this project/game is about simulating dreams, most of them being real dreams that were remodeled into an explorable form, I guess.

The project itself is built on Godot 4.5.1, func_godot, and Jolt Physics.
These are the external programs used so far:
- Trenchbroom
- Krita
- GIMP
- LibreSprite
- MilkyTracker

Generative AI was **not** used to write code or create assets for this project!!
Most of the code is written by hand, although some snippets of code were copied from forum threads, Godot addons, and et cetera.

## Why is this?
Just because.

## How can I modify this project?
1. Install Godot 4.5.1 at godotengine.org 
    (note: if you're several years into the future, be careful, as the project may or may not break with newer versions of Godot!)
2. Clone the project files (fork if needed)
3. Open the project.godot file in Godot ("Import Existing Project")

## How can I compile this project?
See Godot 4.5's documentation at docs.godotengine.org/en/4.5/tutorials/export/index.html

## This sucks.
Sorry :(
